This repo is for the Financial Contagion project where we examine how stocks, US ETFs and cryptocurrencies transmit/receive shocks to/from each other. 
The contagion is observed at a macro level - within and between communities of assets. This is our novel approach that distinguish our study from the existing literature where ones mainly
focus on the contagion between individual assets.
Furthermore, we observe the phenomena across different time windows and market conditions to identify possible patterns in each market condtion. The time period is from April 2019 until May 2023.
